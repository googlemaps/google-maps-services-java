# Java Client for Google Maps Services

> [!TIP]
> If you are looking for Java client libraries for the following APIs, see the [Google Maps Platform APIs in the Cloud Client Libraries for Java](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-java/tree/main) ([releases](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-java/releases?q=maps&expanded=true)).

## Description

Use Java? Want to [geocode][Geocoding API] something? Looking for [directions][Directions API]? This client library brings the following [Google Maps Web Services APIs] to your server-side Java applications:

- [Maps Static API]
- [Directions API]
- [Distance Matrix API]
- [Elevation API]
- [Geocoding API]
- [Places API]
- [Roads API]
- [Time Zone API]

## Requirements

* [Sign up with Google Maps Platform]
* A Google Maps Platform [project] with the desired API(s) from the above list enabled
* An [API key] associated with the project above
* Java 1.8+

## API Key Security

This client library is designed for use in both server and Android applications.

In either case, it is important to add [API key restrictions](https://developers.google.com/maps/api-security-best-practices#restricting-api-keys) to improve its security. Additional security measures, such as hiding your key
from version control, should also be put in place to further improve the security of your API key.

Check out the [API Security Best Practices](https://developers.google.com/maps/api-security-best-practices) guide to learn more.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using this library on Android, ensure that your application is using at least version 0.19.0 of this library so that API key restrictions can be enforced.

## Installation

You can add the library to your project via Maven or Gradle.

> [!NOTE]
> Since 0.1.18 there is now a dependency on [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org/). You need to add one of the adapter dependencies that makes sense for your logging setup. In the configuration samples below we are integrating [slf4j-nop](https://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Corg.slf4j%7Cslf4j-nop%7C1.7.25%7Cjar), but there are others like [slf4j-log4j12](https://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Corg.slf4j%7Cslf4j-log4j12%7C1.7.25%7Cjar) and [slf4j-jdk14](https://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Corg.slf4j%7Cslf4j-jdk14%7C1.7.25%7Cjar) that will make more sense in other configurations. This will stop a warning message being emitted when you start using `google-maps-services`.

### Maven

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.maps</groupId>
  <artifactId>google-maps-services</artifactId>
  <version>(insert latest version)</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>slf4j-simple</artifactId>
  <version>1.7.25</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.google.maps:google-maps-services:(insert latest version)'
    implementation 'org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:1.7.25'
}
```

You can find the latest version at the top of this README or by [searching
Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22google-maps-services%22).

## Documentation

You can find the reference [documentation] at JavaDoc, and each API also has its own set of documentation:
- [Directions API]
- [Distance Matrix API]
- [Elevation API]
- [Geocoding API]
- [Maps Static API]
- [Places API]
- [Roads API]
- [Time Zone API]

## Usage

This example uses the [Geocoding API]:

```java
GeoApiContext context = new GeoApiContext.Builder()
    .apiKey("YOUR_API_KEY")
    .build();
GeocodingResponse response =  GeocodingApi.geocode(context,
    "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043").await();
Gson gson = new GsonBuilder().setPrettyPrinting().create();
System.out.println(gson.toJson(response.results[0].addressComponents));

// Invoke .shutdown() after your application is done making requests
context.shutdown();
```

**Note:** The `GeoApiContext` is designed to be a [Singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern)
in your application. Please instantiate one on application startup, and continue to use it for the
life of your application. This will enable proper QPS enforcement across all of your requests.

At the end of the execution, call the `shutdown()` method of `GeoApiContext`,
otherwise the thread will remain instantiated in memory.

For more usage examples, check out [the tests](src/test/java/com/google/maps).

## Features

### Google App Engine Support

To use [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine) with this client library add the latest [App Engine dependency](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.appengine/appengine-api-1.0-sdk)
to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.google.appengine:appengine-api-1.0-sdk:<latest version>'
}
```

You can then use this client library on App Engine with the following code change:

```java
new GeoApiContext.Builder(new GaeRequestHandler.Builder())
    .apiKey("YOUR_API_KEY")
    .build();
```

The `new GaeRequestHandler.Builder()` argument to `GeoApiContext.Builder`'s `requestHandlerBuilder`
tells the Java Client for Google Maps Services to utilise the appropriate calls for making HTTP
requests from App Engine, instead of the default [OkHttp3](https://square.github.io/okhttp/)
based strategy.

### Rate Limiting

Never sleep between requests again! By default, requests are sent at the expected rate limits for
each web service, typically 50 queries per second for free users. If you want to speed up or slow
down requests, you can do that too, using `new GeoApiContext.Builder().queryRateLimit(qps).build()`.
Note that you still need to manually handle the [delay between the initial request and successive pages](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search#PlaceSearchPaging) when you're paging through multiple result sets.

### Retry on Failure

Automatically retry when intermittent failures occur. That is, when any of the retriable 5xx errors
are returned from the API.

To alter or disable automatic retries, see these methods in `GeoApiContext`:

- `.disableRetries()`
- `.maxRetries()`
- `.retryTimeout()`
- `.setIfExceptionIsAllowedToRetry()`

### POJOs

Native objects for each of the API responses.

### Asynchronous or synchronous -- you choose

All requests support synchronous or asynchronous calling style.

```java
GeocodingApiRequest req = GeocodingApi.newRequest(context).address("Sydney");

// Synchronous
try {
    req.await();
    // Handle successful request.
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Handle error
}

req.awaitIgnoreError(); // No checked exception.

// Async
req.setCallback(new PendingResult.Callback<GeocodingResponse>() {
  @Override
  public void onResult(GeocodingResponse result) {
    // Handle successful request.
  }

  @Override
  public void onFailure(Throwable e) {
    // Handle error.
  }
});
```

## Building the Project

> [!NOTE]
> You will need an API key to run the tests.

```bash
# Compile and package the project
$ ./gradlew jar

# Run the tests
$ ./gradlew test
```
